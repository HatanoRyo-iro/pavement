## Overview

pavement is a package designed to analyze spatial events occurring on roadways. It provides comprehensive toolkit for working with spatial data, empowering users to understand patterns and trends in road-related phenomena.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pavement from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("NONONOexe/pavement")
```

## Usage

This example demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of roads and traffic accidents using pavement:

```{r example}
library(pavement)

segmented_network <- sample_roads |>
  create_road_network() |>
  create_segmented_network(segment_length = 0.5) |>
  assign_event_to_link(events = sample_accidents)
plot(segmented_network, mode = "event")
plot(segmented_network, mode = "count")
```
