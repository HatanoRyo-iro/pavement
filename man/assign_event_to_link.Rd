\title{Assign events to the nearest link}
\usage{
assign_event_to_link(segmented_network, events)
}
\arguments{
\item{segmented_network}{A \code{segmented_network} object, which contains
a list of segmented links and nodes, representing the segmented road
network.}

\item{events}{A \code{sf} object representing events, such as traffic accidents,
with location information.}
}
\value{
A \code{segmented_network} object with events assigned to links. Each
link will have a \code{count} attribute indicating the number of events
assigned to it.
}
\description{
This function assigns events to the nearest link in a segmented road
network.
}
\examples{
# Create the segmented road network
road_network <- create_road_network(sample_roads)
segmented_network <- create_segmented_network(road_network)

# Assign accidents to the nearest link
segmented_network <- assign_event_to_link(
  segmented_network,
  sample_accidents
)

# Plot the segmented road network with events
plot(segmented_network, mode = "event")
}
